A food pick-up ordering app built for a restaurant as a midterm project at Lighthouse Labs with a team of 3.
The app allows a customer (user) to place an order on the restaurantâ€™s web page. Placing an order notifies 
the restaurant with order details and confirms the order with the customer by text message. The restaurant can 
reply to the incoming order with a expected wait time, as well as an additional text when the order is ready for pickup.

- Front-end built using HTML/CSS/SASS, Bootstrap, Javascript, AJAX
- Backend was built using Node.js, Express, and PostreSQL
- Twilio API (modern telecomm API service) was used to allow text messaging between the customer and restaurant
